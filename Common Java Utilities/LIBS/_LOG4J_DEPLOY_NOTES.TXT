Notes for log4j upgrade
Previous version is 2.15.0
Latest version is 2.17.1

1) Update the version history at the top of this page.
2) Before deploying, ask the developer to test the new library in DEV
2) If the library works out of the box, there is no need to recompile the java code.  If not, a new CR will be created before deployment.
3) To deploy a new log4j library, first remove old log4j files from this folder.  Don't rename them, that clutters up the folder with unnecessary files.  If you must keep them, put them in a folder in this folder
4) Copy the new log4j library files into this folder
5) The only log4j files that are needed are log4j-api-(version).jar and log4j-core-(version).jar

Should these steps change, a new version of this document will be created and stored in this folder.
