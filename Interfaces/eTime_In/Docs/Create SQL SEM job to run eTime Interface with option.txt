How to create a Microsoft SQL Sever Enterprise Manager (SEM) job to run the Current Month Posting option of the eTime Interface. 

Reference Defect No. 782

These instructions are provided with the assumption that the user is familiar with the basic functional navigation of SEM's main interface window.

From the main SEM interface window, select menu command Action/New Job. The New Job Properties window opens.

Step 1: Create the first of two SEM jobs - tentatively called Run eTime Interface w/Current Month Posting option

On the General tab, type the job name and description. Accept all default values.
(Note: SEM supplies the Source server specification upon a successful save.)

Click the Steps tab. 

This first job has two steps. Click the New button. The New Job Step window opens.

For the first step's data entry, on the General tab, type/select the following.

Step Name: GetFileName
Type:      Transact-SQL Script (TSQL)
Database:  IMAPSStg [the name of the database where this SEM job is to be executed]
Command:

DECLARE @out_msg varchar(245)

EXEC XX_UPDATE_PROCESS_PARAM_SP
   @in_CMD_PATH = '\\Ffx2kdap11\interfaces\programs\batch\getfilename.bat',
   @in_SEARCH_PATH = '\\Ffx2kdap11\inbox\etime\',
   @in_RESULT_PATH = '\\Ffx2kdap11\interfaces\process\common\Result.txt',
   @in_FORMAT_PATH = '\\Ffx2kdap11\interfaces\format\infilenameformat.fmt',
   @IN_SOURCE_PARM = 'IN_TS_SOURCE_FILENAME',
   @in_INTERFACE_NAME = 'ETIME',
   @OUT_Error_Message = @out_msg OUTPUT

The user may click the Parse button to compile the TSQL command.
(A successful parse disables the Parse button, until the TSQL command is changed.)

The New Job Properties window's Advance tab usually provides the desired default data.

Click OK to save. The New Job Step window is closed.

The user is returned to the New Job Properties window. To edit the step data, select the desired step and click the Edit button.
To create the next step, click the New button. The New Job Step window opens. 

For the second step's data entry, type/select the following.

Step Name: KickOff eTime Processing
Type:      Transact-SQL Script (TSQL)
Database:  IMAPSStg [the name of the database where this SEM job is to be executed]
Command:

DECLARE @ret_code integer

EXEC @ret_code = dbo.XX_RUN_ETIME_INTERFACE
   @current_month_posting_ind = 'Y'

IF @ret_code <> 0
   RAISERROR('FAILURE', 16, 1)

Click the New Job Properties window's Advance tab. Provide a file name string complete with file directory path for TSQL script command options.

Click OK to save. The New Job Step window is closed. The user is returned to the New Job Properties window.
Click OK to save the job. The New Job Properties window is closed.

The just-created job now appears as an entry on the SEM interface window's right pane. To edit the job's properties, right-click desired job entry
row and select the Properies option from the popup menu. This opens the same job properties widow now with the window title "Run eTime Interface
w/Current Month Posting option." Edit job properties using the navigation techniques that were used to create the job.

Step 2: Create the second of two SEM jobs - tentatively called Run eTime Interface CloseOut w/Current Month Posting option

To create the second job, use the same procedures (navigation techniques) that were used to create the first job. The second job has two steps.

For the first step's data entry, type/select the following.

Step Name: Costpoint Timesheet Preprocessor Completion
Type:      Transact-SQL Script (TSQL)
Database:  IMAPSStg [the name of the database where this SEM job is to be executed]
Command:   EXEC dbo.XX_UPDATE_PROCESS_STATUS_SP

Click OK to save.

For the second step's data entry, type/select the following.

Step Name: eTimesheet Final Process
Type:      Transact-SQL Script (TSQL)
Database:  IMAPSStg [the name of the database where this SEM job is to be executed]
Command:   EXEC dbo.XX_RUN_ET_POSTCOSTPOINT_PROC

Click OK to save.

The just-created job now appears as an entry on the SEM interface window's right pane.
