You don't have to organize your jobs this way, but it works for me.
Also, the log file instructions in each job are carefully arranged to put the entire run into one file.  The first job creates a new file, 
and all subsequent jobs append to the same file.  Please do this in production in such a way that developers don't need OPS help to access the file.
