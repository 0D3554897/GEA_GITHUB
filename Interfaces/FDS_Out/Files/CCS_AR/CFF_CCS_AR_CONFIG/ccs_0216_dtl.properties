#sql.to_ebcdic = 0 means don't; 1 means do it; 2 means do it AND create a 2nd plain text file
#sql.ebcdic_columns  =0 for none, otherwise CSV list of nth columns in sql.query to be converted  
#  Example: SELECT ONE,TWO,THREE,FOUR FROM TBL;  sql.ebcdic_columns=3,4 will perform ebcdic packing conversion on THREE and FOUR
#sql.fixneg = 0 for NO, 1 for YES.  Strips neg sign and leading zeroes off numbers and maintains sign.  YES for packed decimals.
